**Notes**

Prerequisites
1. Download .NET Core 2.2 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2. 
2. IIS must be enabled in your machine (if you are not using Visual Studio). 
3. Microsft SQL Server and the Management Studio
4. If you are opening the project in Visual Studio, make sure the NuGet packages are restored correctly.

If you do not have Visual Studio but wish to view/test the app, please request someone who has Visual Studio to build and generate you a package to be configured into IIS. 

Check https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/development-time-iis-support?view=aspnetcore-2.2 if you encounter any issues configuring the app into IIS.

If you do have Visual Studio and SSMS, open Package Manager Console in Tools > NuGet Package Manager and run the command *Update-Database*.
