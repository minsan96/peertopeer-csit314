# Peer To Peer Learning CSIT-314

**Notes**

Prerequisites
1. Download .NET Core 2.2 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2. 
2. IIS must be enabled in your machine (if you are not using Visual Studio). 

If you do not have Visual Studio but wish to view/test the app, please request someone who has Visual Studio to build and generate you a package to be configured into IIS. 

Check https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/development-time-iis-support?view=aspnetcore-2.2 if you encounter any issues configuring the app into IIS.
